About Panel
===========

Panel is completely open source, available under a BSD license freely for both commercial and non-commercial use. Panel is part of the HoloViz ecosystem and works well with all the HoloViz tools.

Panel was originally developed with the support of `Anaconda Inc. <https://anaconda.com>`_, and is now maintained by Anaconda developers and community contributors.

If you are interested in contributing to Panel development, you can see our list of open issues that you could help address, including possible larger wishlist items. And if you are lucky enough to be in a position to fund our developers to work on documentation, features, or bug fixes, please contact sales@anaconda.com.
